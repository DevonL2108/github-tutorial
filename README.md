> An **SSH** (Secure Shell) **key** is used to establish secure shell sessions between your computer and the insecure networks you access. It is highly needed because it is a key that only you can access and no one else can make changes to it. It is private and should not be shared. It is also used so you won't have to login to your GitHub account everytime you make a commit.
